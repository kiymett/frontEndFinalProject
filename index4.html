            He was a student of Louis-Jules André at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. His first exhibit was in 1880, at the Salon des Artistes Français, where he was awarded a third-class medal. The following year, his designs for a "fine arts palace" earned him the Prix de Rome. 
            He was a resident at the Académie de France à Rome from 1882 to 1885. Upon returning to France he continued to exhibit at the Salon, obtaining a second-class medal in 1887,
            and a medal of honor in 1888. He achieved a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle in 1889. After 1890, he served as head of the architecture studio at the École. 
            For the Exposition Universelle of 1900, he participated in the design and construction of the Grand Palais (1896-1900). He was in charge of the nave and façade, overlooking what is now the Avenue Winston-Churchill.
            Over the next two decades, he created numerous homes and shops, as well as monuments to Lazare Carnot, Joseph François Dupleix, William Shakespeare, Joan of Arc, and Guy de Maupassant.
            His work on the Grand Palais earned him a place as an officer in the Legion of Honor. In 1918, he was elected a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, taking Seat #1 for architecture, which he held until his death.
            He was able to purchase the Château de Laussel, a sixteenth-century castle near Marquay, and spent his later years restoring it.

                The grand opening was held on May 1, 1900. From the very beginning the palace was the site of different kinds of shows in addition to the intended art exhibitions. 
                These included a riding competition that took place annually from 1901 to 1957, but were mainly dedicated to innovation and modernity: the automobile, aviation, household appliances, and so on. 
                The golden age of the art exhibitions as such lasted for some thirty years, while the last took place in 1947. 
                The first major Henri Matisse retrospective after his death was held at the Grand Palais. 
                The main space, almost 240 metres long, was constructed with an iron, steel and glass barrel-vaulted roof, making it the last of the large transparent structures inspired by London’s Crystal Palace that were necessary for large gatherings of people before the age of electricity. 
                The main space was originally connected to the other parts of the palace along an east-west axis by a grand staircase in a style combining Classical and Art Nouveau, but the interior layout has since been somewhat modified.
                The exterior of this massive palace combines an imposing Classical stone façade with a riot of Art Nouveau ironwork, and a number of allegorical statue groups including work by sculptors Paul Gasq, Camille Lefèvre, Alfred Boucher, Alphonse-Amédée Cordonnier and Raoul Verlet. 
                A monumental bronze quadriga by Georges Récipon tops each wing of the main façade. The one on the Champs-Élysées side depicts Immortality prevailing over Time, the one on the Seine side Harmony triumphing over Discord.
