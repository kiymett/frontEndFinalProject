        <p class="text1">
            The city of Paris has notable examples of architecture of every period, from the Middle Ages to the 21st
            century.
            It was the birthplace of the Gothic style, and has important monuments of the French Renaissance, Classical
            revival, the Flamboyant style of the reign of Napoleon III, the Belle Époque, and the Art Nouveau style.
            The great Exposition Universelle (1889) and 1900 added Paris landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower and Grand
            Palais.
            In the 20th century, the Art Deco style of architecture first appeared in Paris,
            and Paris architects also influenced the postmodern architecture of the second half of the century.
            The Hôtel de Sens, one of many remnants of the Middle Ages in Paris
            During the Hundred Years' War, Paris was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, 
            before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420;
            in spite of a 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city, it would remain under English occupation until 1436.

            <p class="text1">
                The rapidly growing French economy under Napoleon III led to major changes in the
                architecture and urban design of Paris. New types of architecture connected with the economic expansion;
                railroad stations, hotels, office buildings, department stores and exposition halls,
                occupied the center of Paris, which previously had been largely residential.
                To improve traffic circulation and bring light and air to the center of the city, Napoleon's Prefect of
                the Seine, destroyed the crumbling and overcrowded neighborhoods in the heart of the city and built a
                network of grand boulevards.
                The expanded use of new building materials, especially iron frames, allowed the construction of much
                larger buildings for commerce and industry.
                Following the completion of the project on schedule Eiffel was appointed as the principal engineer of the Compagnie Belge. 
                His work had also gained the attention of several people who were later to give him work, including Stanislas de la Roche Toulay, 
                who had prepared the design for the metalwork of the Bordeaux bridge, Jean Baptiste Krantz and Wilhelm Nordling.
