            Charles Garnier was born Jean-Louis Charles Garnier on 6 November 1825 in Paris, on the Rue Mouffetard, in the present-day 5th arrondissement. 
            His father, Jean" André Garnier, 1796–1865, who was originally from Sarthe, a department of the French region of Pays de la Loire, had worked as a blacksmith, wheelwright, 
            and coachbuilder before settling down in Paris to work in a horse-drawn carriage rental business. He married Felicia Colle, daughter of a captain in the French Army.
            Later in life Garnier would all but ignore the fact that he was born of humble origins, preferring to claim Sarthe as his birthplace.

            The Palais Garnier in April 2017 On 30 December 1860 the Second Empire of Emperor Napoleon III announced a competition for the design of a new, state-funded opera house. 
            The old opera house, located on the rue Le Peletier [fr] and known as the Salle Le Peletier, had been constructed as a temporary theatre in 1821. 
            Street access to that theatre was greatly constricted; and after an attempted assassination of Napoleon III at the theatre's entrance on 14 January 1858, 
            it was decided to build a new opera house with a separate, more secure entrance for the head of state. 
            Applicants were given a month to submit entries. There were two phases to the competition, and Garnier was one of about 170 entrants in the first phase.[2] He was awarded the fifth-place prize and was one of seven finalists selected for the second phase.
            The second phase required the contestants to revise their original projects and was more rigorous, with a 58-page program, written by the director of the Opéra, Alphonse Royer, which the contestants received on 18 April. 
            The new submissions were sent to the jury in the middle of May, and on 29 May Garnier's project was selected for its "rare and superior qualities in the beautiful distribution of the plans, the monumental and characteristic aspect of the facades and sections".
