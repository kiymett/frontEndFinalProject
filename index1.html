                Alexandre Gustave Eiffel was born in France, in the Côte-d'Or, the first child of Catherine-Mélanie (née
                Moneuse) and Alexandre Bonickhausen dit Eiffel. He was a descendant of Marguerite Frédérique (née
                Lideriz) and Jean-René Bönickhausen and who had emigrated from the German town of Marmagen and settled
                in Paris at the beginning of the 18th century.
                The family adopted the name Eiffel as a reference to the Eifel mountains in the region from which they
                had come. Although the family always used the name Eiffel, Gustave's name was registered at birth as
                Bonickhausen dit Eiffel,and was not formally changed to Eiffel until 1880.
                At the time of Gustave's birth his father, an ex-soldier, was working as an administrator for the French
                Army; but shortly after his birth his mother expanded a charcoal business she had inherited from her
                parents to include a coal-distribution business, and soon afterwards his father gave up his job to
                assist her.

                Due to his mother's business commitments, Gustave spent his childhood living with his grandmother, but
                nevertheless remained close to his mother, who was to remain an influential figure until her death in
                1878. The business was successful enough for Catherine Eiffel to sell it in 1843 and retire on the
                proceeds.
                Eiffel was not a studious child, and thought his classes at the Lycée Royal in Dijon boring and a waste
                of time, although in his last two years, influenced by his teachers for history and literature, he began
                to study seriously, and he gained his baccalauréats in humanities and science.
                An important part in his education was played by his uncle, Jean-Baptiste Mollerat, who had invented a
                process for distilling vinegar and had a large chemical works near Dijon, and one of his uncle's
                friends, the chemist Michel Perret. Both men spent a lot of time with the young Eiffel, teaching him
                about everything from chemistry and mining to theology and philosophy.
                Eiffel went on to attend the Collège Sainte-Barbe in Paris, to prepare for the difficult entrance exams
                set by engineering colleges in France, and qualified for entry to two of the most prestigious schools –
                École polytechnique and École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures – and ultimately entered the latter.
                During his second year he chose to specialize in chemistry, and graduated ranking at 13th place out of
                80 candidates in 1855. This was the year that Paris hosted the second World's Fair, and Eiffel was
                bought a season ticket by his mother.
